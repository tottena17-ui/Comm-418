My final project story will be about public schools in the U.S. I found a dataset on data.gov that shows characteristics of all of the public schools in the U.S. in 2023-2024. This include name, address, phone number, type of school, location, number of teachers, number of students, and student demographic information. After taking a closer look at the data, I will be able to tell which direction the story will go in. Do rural schools have a different amount of teachers compared to suburban or city schools? Are there a disproportionate about of schools in one county in a state compared to another? What types of students are going to technical schools and why? I could also focus on a specific state, maybe Washington D.C. What is the student demographic makeup of different Washington D.C. schools? Are there a handful of schools that have more enrollment than other schools and why? Data.gov provided additional information that will make it easy to verify the data’s authenticity including metadata, the publisher, and other important information. In terms of the story, the dataset includes phone numbers. So, if there is a school that is an outlier, I can call the school and include their response in my story. Doing some analysis on the data will provide valuable insights that will steer the direction of my story.
