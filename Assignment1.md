This histogram shows the comm-418 class' familiarity with programming in R in comparison to their familairity with other programming langauges.
I made the histogram by creating two pivot tables, one with programming in R data and the other with the other languages. They both showed the familiarity ratings and counts for each rating.
Then I made that data into one graph, setting the rating scale (0-4) as the x-axis and the count as the y-axis and having the two pivot tables as two series. 
The graph shows that people in comm-418 are more unfamiliar with R than script programming since R has 14 0 ratings compared to the other languages with 10 0 ratings.
