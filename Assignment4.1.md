RE: Freedom of Information Act Request
Dear FOIA Officer, 
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552).
I request copies of the budget report for the D.C. Department of Public Works, District Snow Team. As well as, the written plan of action the District Snow Team had for the snow storm that occured on 1/25/26. 
I am willing to pay search and duplication fees up to $100. Please inform me if the estimated fees will exceed this limit.
Please send the documents to me in electronic format at at0456a@american.edu
Sincerely,
Ashley Totten

Note: I chose to do a FOIA as if I were doing a story on the slow snow cleanup after the story last week. Sidewalk entrances and bus stops are still covered in snow. Who is responsible for cleaning up the streets? How much resources do they have to do that?
