Here is a link to the article: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2026/01/21/catholicism-has-declined-in-latin-america-over-the-past-decade/
The Pew Research Center published a journalistic report discussing how catholicism has declinined in Latin America over the last decade. I found the article interesting because of the visuals. There is one graph in the beginning that encapsulates what the report is saying. It shows each country, the percentage of their population who identified as Catholic in 2014, then another bar for 2024. The side by side comparision in multiple countries is striking. The feature that made the graph the msot readable was an indicator after each country that showed how much percentage change there was between 2014 and 2024. This clearly illustrated that the 6 countries shown all had drops in the percentage of people identifying as Catholic. There article was also easy to read with the msot important conclusions being in bold.
