How many daycare centers in D.C. are near their maximum capacity? 
This dataset will help answer that question: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::child-development-centers/about
It will help answer the question because it examines D.C. children development centers and measures the number of children and the maximum capacity of each facility. It has all the necessary categories to answer the question, and more that will add nuance to the story. I can measure how many daycare centers are near their maximum capacity and sort it by ward to see if there is a regional correlation. This dataset is a good dataset because it is relevant to the question being asked. Also, it is coming from a reputable source, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education via Open Data D.C. and it is relatively recent data being updated last year. The dataset is clean, easy to read, and detailed. It shows the location of the centers written four different ways, two types of coordinates and two columns of addresses written with different formatting to ensure continuity. This level of detail is a good sign of a reliable data set. Some further steps I can take to vet it is to google each of the child development centers to verify the information in the dataset that is available online, like the name of the facility and street address.
