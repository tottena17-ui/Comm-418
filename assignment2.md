How many daycare centers in D.C. are near their maximum capacity? 
This dataset will help answer that question: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::child-development-centers/about
It will help answer the question because it examines D.C. children development centers and measures the number of children and the maximum capacity of each facility. It has all the necessary categories to answer the question. This dataset is a good dataset because it is relevant to the question being asked. Also, it is coming from a reputable source, the D.C. Health Administration via Open Data D.C. and it is relatively recent data being updated last year. The dataset is clean, easy to read, and detailed. Some further steps I can take to vet it is to google each of the child deevelopment centers to verify the information in the dataset.
