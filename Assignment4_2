What does AU post about on their Instagram account? Are they as political attune as the studnets of the university?
I collected the data by scrolling through the AU Instagram account and tracking the date of the post, the content of it, how many comments, and the comment type. 
What I found is much different than my initial question. A new question emerged: What type of comments are left on AU posts by the AU community?

From an inital observation of 5 posts, the comments of the post varied widely from praise, to neutral or negative remarks about university policy, but one comment type was very suprising. All of the 5 posts had comments about Professor Earl Wayne, the professor mentioned in the Epstein files. If this investigation were to continue I would look deeper into AU's posts and see how many comment about this professor. I would also look across different social media platforms like TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, and more.
